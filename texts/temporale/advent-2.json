        "text1": "FROM the beginning of the Book of this Prophet to Chapter 13, where commenceth the Burden (that is, the Oracle or Vision) of the whole of the vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, is one continual prophecy of Christ. We must explain it line by line, for to comment on it as a whole would only confuse the reader. Isaiah saith : And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots. According to the Jewish commentators, the Branch, (that is to say, a flower,) and the rod both refer to the Lord himself. They take the rod to mean the sceptre of his royal dominion, and the flower the loveliness of his beauty.",
        "text2": "WE, however, understand the stem of Jesse to signify the holy Virgin Mary. She was a virgin-stem that had as yet put forth no shoot, as we have read above : Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son. And the Branch of blossom flowering from this stem, we understand to be the Lord our Redeemer, who saith in the Song of Songs : I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of the valley.",
        "text3": "THE Spirit of the Lord, saith Isaiah, shall rest upon this flower which shall come forth from the stem and root of Jesse by means of the Virgin Mary. And truly the Spirit of the Lord did rest upon our Redeemer. It is written that in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily. The Spirit was not shed on him by measure, as it is upon the Saints. To him we may apply the words of the Hebrew Gospel used by the Nazarenes, to wit : The whole fountain of the Holy Ghost shall be poured forth upon him. Of this the Apostle saith : Now the Lord is that Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."

Wherefore, to wean our hearts from earthly affections, he foretelleth what evils will befall the world in its old age, and what great commotions will come to pass before the end, so that if we fear not God in times of security, we will at least be warned into fearing his judgement when it is at hand.",
        "text2": "A LITTLE before the passage which hath just been read from the Gospel, are these words of our Lord : Nation shall rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences. Then, after a few more verses, cometh today's Gospel : There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring. Now some of these things are already come to pass, and we fear that the others are not far off.",
        "text3": "IN these our days we see more rising of nation against nation, and more distress upon the earth, than we have read of in books as ever having come to pass of old time. Ye know also how often we hear of earthquakes overwhelming countless cities in other of the world. As for pestilences, we ourselves suffer from them without end. As yet we do not see signs the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, but the changes of seasons climates warn us that before long may look for these also."
