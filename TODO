Fix anchors on buttons - hitting find texts should scroll to results
Add scroll-to-top button (small, red, bottom right)
Some nicer styling for results contents
Consider difficulties caused by non-standard texts as they arise
Check and fix mobile layout
Work out how to OCR a ton of texts
OCR, proof, format into JSON files, and integrate new texts/occasions
Deal with issues arising from this with JS logic
Make reading as comfortable as possible - consider texts, colours
Consider aligning header items with page content
Build out a nicer UI for selecting an occasion, particularly as more are added
Add other ways to select an occasion, e.g. 'today' button, date picker (would require coding liturgical calendar), range of mutliple occasions
Add option to include pericope in results

Long term ideas:
Mobile app
Fill in extra texts from other sources
