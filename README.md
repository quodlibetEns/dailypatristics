DAILY PATRISTICS

A project to retrieve patristic sermons and homilies for every day of the liturgical year.

ABOUT

The project is designed to return brief patristic sermons and homilies for each day of the Western liturgical kalendar. At least in the first instance, all the texts will be those found in the Anglican Breviary - which are almost entirely English translations of those found in the Roman breviary (1911 rubrics). This will mean in practice that not every day has its own texts: ordinary feriae will borrow from the preceding Sunday; low-ranking feasts from the commons.

Integration of additional sources to enrich the whole kalendar would be a possible future project once the first phase is working.

STRUCTURE

This is a web project, planned to consist of a single html page, with a stylesheet, and a single script for processing user requests and returning the correct text.

The texts are stored in a number of JSON files, which are in appropriate directories following closely the Anglican Breviary's structure, all within the 'texts' directory.

Once the web version is up and running, if it proves useful, there is no reason why equivalent mobile apps couldn't be developed too.
